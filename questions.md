- Do you need these for deep learning?

Lots of math - False
Lots of data - False
Lots of expensive computers False
A PhD False
- Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.
1. Natural Language Processing
2. Computer Vision
3. Medicine: Finding anomalies in radiology images
4. Biology: Folding and classifying proteins
5. Image gneration
- What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
The perceptron, specifically the Mark I perceptron. 

- Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?
1. processing units
2. state of activation
3. output funcion per unit
4. connectivity between units
5. propagation rule for propagating activity through connections
6. activation rule, combine inputs to a unit to produce output
7. learnign rule, patterns of connections are modified by experience
8. An environment for the system to operate

- What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?
 Misunderstood that a single extra layer (two layers), would be enough to approximate most mathematical fns
 In practice they were two big/slow to be useful

What is a GPU?
- A graphical processing unit, capable of executing thousands of single tasks at the same time
Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens?
- The result is 2, from a python3 kernel notebook. 

Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.

Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.

Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?
- Extremely hard. You'd have to teach a program how to recognize each characteristic of an image, like edges, colors, gradients, shapes. 

What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment"?
- 
What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?

Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model.

Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?

What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?

What do you need in order to train a model?

How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?

Do we always have to use 224Ã—224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?

What is the difference between classification and regression?

What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?

What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?

Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?

What is overfitting? Provide an example.

What is a metric? How does it differ from "loss"?

How can pretrained models help?

What is the "head" of a model?

What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?

Are image models only useful for photos?

What is an "architecture"?

What is segmentation?

What is y_range used for? When do we need it?

What are "hyperparameters"?
